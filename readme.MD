# Revolving Solutions
## Project:
AI CV Generator
## Overview of the project
A challenge for job seekers in South Africa is the creation of an effective CV, cover letter, or
email that can make them stand out to potential employers. Many job seekers lack the
necessary knowledge and skills to craft high-quality job application documents that
highlight their strengths and experiences.
The AI CV Generator aims to aid job seekers in creating appealing job application
documents that will increase their chances of acquiring a job.
