# Survey

When clicking on the Survey button on the home page, you will be greeted with a few prompts. Enter the information it requires and move on to the next prompt. You can add more to the information (for example, if you have multiple work experiences or have multiple qualifications) by clicking the add button. This should add more fields.

Once all this information has been added, you can click the final save and proceed button so that the system can save your information and generate a CV for you which you can preview, share, or download.
