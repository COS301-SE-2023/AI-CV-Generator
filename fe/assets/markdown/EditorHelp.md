# Editor Page

Once your CV has been generated, you can change your template or edit the CV by clicking the edit button on the home page. This will take you to the editor page, and here you can edit almost all information in the CV as well as add or remove any information. The colors that make up the template of the CV, as well as the font colors, can also be changed here to match your needs.
