# App Navigation

On the home page, there is a burger menu (3 line icon) at the top left of the screen. From this burger menu, you have multiple options as to what you can do:

- Home (docile, as you are already on the home page)
- Profile Page: This will take you to view your profile and adjust information as you see fit.
- About Page: This will take you to a page where you can learn more about us.
- Logout: This button will take you out of the app and back to the Login page.
